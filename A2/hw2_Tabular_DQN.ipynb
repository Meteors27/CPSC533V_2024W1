    "#  Part 1 [54 pts] Tabular Q-Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "Tabular Q-learning is an RL algorithm for problems with discrete states and discrete actions. The algorithm is described in the class notes, which borrows the summary description from [Section 6.5](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf#page=153) of Richard Sutton's RL book. In the tabular approach, the Q-value is represented as a lookup table. As discussed in class, Q-learning can further be extended to continuous states and discrete actions, leading to the [Atari DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) / Deep Q-learning algorithm.  However, it is important and informative to first fully understand tabular Q-learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, Q-learning works as follows: The goal is to learn the optimal Q-function: \n",
    "`Q(s,a)`, which is the *value* of being at state `s` and taking action `a`.  Q tells you how well you expect to do, on average, from here on out, given that you act optimally.  Once the Q function is learned, choosing an optimal action is as simple as looping over all possible actions and choosing the one with the highest Q (optimal action $a^* = \\text{argmax}_a Q(s,a)$).  To learn Q, we initialize it arbitrarily and then iteratively refine it using the Bellman backup equation for Q functions, namely: \n",
    "$Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha [r + \\gamma \\text{max}_a Q(s', a) - Q(s,a)]$.\n",
    "Here, $r$ is the reward associated with with the transition from state s to s', and $\\alpha$ is a learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of assignment you will implement tabular Q-learning and apply it to CartPole -- an environment with a **continuous** state space.  To apply the tabular method, you will need to discretize the CartPole state space by dividing the state-space into bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "- to become familiar with python/numpy, as well as using an OpenAI Gym environment\n",
    "- to understand tabular Q-learning, by implementing tabular Q-Learning for \n",
    "  a discretized version of a continuous-state environment, and experimenting with the implementation\n",
    "- (optional) to develop further intuition regarding possible variations of the algorithm"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Deep reinforcement learning has generated impressive results for board games ([Go][go], [Chess/Shogi][chess]), video games ([Atari][atari], [DOTA2][dota], [StarCraft II][scii]), [and][baoding] [robotic][rubix] [control][anymal] ([of][cassie] [course][mimic] ;)).  RL is beginning to work for an increasing range of tasks and capabilities.  At the same time, there are many [gaping holes][irpan] and [difficulties][amid] in applying these methods. Understanding deep RL is important if you wish to have a good grasp of the modern landscape of control methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "These next several assignments are designed to get you started with deep reinforcement learning, to give you a more close and personal understanding of the methods, and to provide you with a good starting point from which you can branch out into topics of interest. You will implement basic versions of some of the important fundamental algorithms in this space, including Q-learning and policy gradient/search methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only have time to cover a subset of methods and ideas in this space.\n",
    "If you want to dig deeper, we suggest following the links given on the course webpage.  Additionally we draw special attention to the [Sutton book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf) for RL fundamentals and in depth coverage, and OpenAI's [Spinning Up resources](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html) for a concise intro to RL and deep RL concepts, as well as good comparisons and implementations of modern deep RL algorithms.\n",
